Assamptions:

1. Only one pipeline modyfies auto scaling group
There s a possible issue in case one pipeline has started,
Another pipeline has started
then, first one creates new EC2 and wait,
but the second one will try to use EC2 immediatelly because
AS will says (DesiredCapacity == 1)

2. ASG event should setup instance event.
ASG gets Launch event before instance checks.
So, we need to tag run instance and
puOK only on EC2 checks complete.
